            <p>A large scale research performed by Immigration Department of the 
                United States revealed that one of the most significant enablers 
                to attract more tourists to the US will be to make its visa application 
                and processing simpler. That was a no-brainer, because the more complex the process, 
                the higher will be the friction for first time travellers and hence a lower turnout 
                on tourist arrivals. Since then, the department initiated a series of tasks to make 
                the visa application process simpler, including the usage of technology.
